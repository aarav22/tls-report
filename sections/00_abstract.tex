The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed the Transport Layer Security (TLS) working group to develop a standardized SSL-like protocol. In 1999, the group released the specification for the TLS 1.0 protocol \cite{rfc793}, which is a minor variation of SSL 3.0 and is sometimes referred to as SSL version 3.1. In 2006 and 2008, minor updates were made to TLS 1.0, leading to the development of TLS version 1.2. However, due to numerous security vulnerabilities, TLS 1.2 was overhauled in 2017, resulting in the much stronger TLS version 1.3 \cite{rfc8446}. TLS has become widely used in software systems worldwide. This report will mostly focus on TLS 1.3.
